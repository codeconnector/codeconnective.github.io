# Code Connector Website

[www.codeconnector.io](https://www.codeconnector.io) is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based website hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Local Development

A standard Ruby environment is needed in order to develop this website locally. If you do not have Ruby, you can follow the [Jekyll installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

After Ruby and Bundler are installed, within the project folder, run:
```
bundle install
```

Then, run the site with `jekyll`:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you have Jekyll installed globally, you can simply run:
```
jekyll serve
```

The site will be available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
